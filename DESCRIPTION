Description: Visualizr provides a set of useful statistics and plots
    on new data to help automate EDA using Rmarkdown files. The primary goal of
    the package is to provide better understanding of what variables and data 
    are important in less time, while giving the user the ability to edit 
    templated Rmd files and tune generic plots.
